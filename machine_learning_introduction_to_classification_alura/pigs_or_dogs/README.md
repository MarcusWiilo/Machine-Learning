# Project 1: Classification
## Sorting between pig and dog

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5.2** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [MultinomialNB](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html/)

### Instructions

This is a simple example of classification explained in an Alura video in the Machine Learning course, introduction to classification.

In this project we teach the algorithm how to identify if a mysterious element is a dog or a pig. The main features used for this example were whether the animal is fat, whether the animal has small legs and whether the animal barks or not.

### Code

Code is provided in the file `classification.py`.

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `pigs_or_dogs/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```python classification.py```

## V2 Implementation

### Instructions

In this second version of the file I implemented a validation of the acuracy of the model in question.

- It continues at 100%

Model still very simple yet functional, you can better understand learning algorithms with this code.

### Code

Code is provided in the file `classification_v2_validation.py`.
